The best thing to do and it worked for me is download the [HSPA+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BBsRs.HSPAP.Tweaker) Tweaker from google play store.

I dont know for sure but i it works by sending extra data packages to trick the provider into thinking you are in need of a higher and faster connection, thus making your phone stay on H+ rather than dropping down to 3g or less.

> Go to Settings -
Set "Service type" to "file load"
Set Command retry interval to 1sec.
Now tap on H button and it's done.

I had the exact same problem and it is now sorted with this app.

It may use extra data but it is worth it when you need a quick boost, if you have unlimited data allowance you are laughing really.

you can switch the app off within a swipe and a tap so it really is an all round handy app.
