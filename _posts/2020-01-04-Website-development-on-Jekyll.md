Jekyll is the most popular static site generator. It takes the source files and creates a site from static pages that are ready to serve users directly. It is different from how traditional CMS like WordPress works. WordPress uses the server language and databases to generate the page when requested by the user.

Unlike blogging or CMS engines like Wordpress or Ghost, the result of Jekyll's work is not executable programs in a programming language, but static HTML files. Therefore, to host, the site does not need PHP, Node, databases, and powerful hosting. Distribution of static files creates a minimum load on the server, so most often the cheapest hosting is enough. The Jekyll site can be hosted for free on Github Pages. .
