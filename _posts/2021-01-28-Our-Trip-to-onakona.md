I along with my friends visited the Onakona temple on January 26th. This temple is located at Onakona village which is about 35 kms from Dhamtari. It was built by Tirath Raj Futun, a businessman from Dhamtari. This temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The beautiful artwork of the temple is similar to that of the Trayambakeshwar temple of Nashik. However, the temple is still under construction, the idol has not been established yet.

It was crowded as it was a holiday. We enjoyed the boat ride the most and glimpsed the calm flow of the water and landscape view of dense forest and hills. We clicked many pictures, wondered how beautiful this place would look in the evening. Even though the sun's heat exhausted all of us, we enjoyed every bit of it. Overall it was a wonderful experience for us.
