{% highlight javascript %}

var inputs = document.getElementsByClassName('_42ft _4jy0 _4jy3 _517h _51sy');

If you go through friend list and unfollow selectively it will take much more time, but if you you want to follow all friends again then repeat the same procedure it will take a few seconds. In similar way you can unfollow all groups and pages. 

How it works?

Browser follows the given javascript's for loop and clicks all the follow button which are having same class names.

Thanks!
