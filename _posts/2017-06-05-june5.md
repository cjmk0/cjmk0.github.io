It's just a coincidence that birthday of mine and my brothers fall on the same day. However, my brother is two years older than me. My family always celebrated our birthdays together cutting the same cake, so I usually had a joint birthday with my brother. My parents were really perfect about it and always made us feel special on our birthday, they have always been supportive of us.



Thanks for all the wishes!!
